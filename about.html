<h1>Shnyar Baram</h1>
<p>
 My name is Shnyar, and I am 21 years old, currently studying Computer Science in the third stage at the
     University of Sulaimani. Being part of this college has been an incredible journey, as it has not only
      deepened my knowledge but also allowed me to meet amazing friends who have made my experience truly special.
       From working on group projects to sharing memorable moments, my time at university has been filled with growth and joy.
        Outside of my academic life, I enjoy relaxing by watching movies, with a particular fondness for Korean dramas.
         Their captivating stories and unique characters have become one of my favorite ways to unwind and stay inspired.
